# This Taskfile is configured to minimise dependencies and run most tasks in a
# semi-sequential way, which reduces issues with parallel task contexts being
# cancelled following failures. This helps the interval stay low. However, if
# there are issues with tasks running continuously, or being re-added to the
# queue multiple times due to regular changes, increase the value for the watch
# interval to take into account the typical longest running task in the set.

# Enforce the pipefail option in the Bash library to ensure that where commands
# are run through pipes, the failure of any one step in the pipeline fails the
# whole pipe. For example, terraform |& tee will not normally fail if Terraform
# fails as tee almost always will exit cleanly, unless pipefail is set.

  default:
    desc: Run the development and integration tasks once
    summary: |-
      Clean the environment and then run the development and integration tasks
      for all resources by testing and checking the code and files, but only
      once rather than continuously.

      Use the following command for additional information on the steps
      involved:

    cmds:
      - task: develop

  develop:
    desc: Continuously run the development and integration tasks
    summary: |-
      The develop task is designed to perform continuous integration on code
      changes within this repository, first by cleaning the repository and then
      running the following tasks when any relevant files are changed:

      - Lint all supported files, ensuring their layout and syntax are correct
        and consistent before staging and commiting changes;
      - Validate the Terraform configuration to ensure it is valid and can be
        run to configure and deploy resources;
      - Run static code analysis against the Terraform configuration and any
        Flux/Kubernetes resoruces to look for potential security issues or
        misconfigurations;
      - Ensure all documentation is kept up to date, where it is automated.

  lint:
    desc: Lint selected files within this repository
    summary: |-
      Run linting checks across the GitHub Workflows, repository configuration
      files, Terraform (and other) code, and all documentation to find any
      potential issues within the repository by running the following steps:

      - Parse all JSON, YAML, and Markdown files through Prettier in order to
        ensure they are syntactically correct, and that they are consistent in
        their layout and usage;
      - Parse selected configurations (Task files, GitHub Renovate
        configuration, and GitHub Workflows) through JSON Schema to evaluate
        these free-from configuration types are correctly structured for their
        intended usage (i.e. keys are in the right place, the values are what is
        expected or supported, and required settings are present);
      - Review the format of Markdown files to ensure they are clean and
        minimise the ability for the page to be incorrectly rendered, such as
        de-duplicating headers, consistent text width, formatted list items,
        and code layouts.
      - Run tflint on the Terraform configuration, making sure that any
        Terraform code is syntactically correct, properly formatted, and mostly
        valid for runtime (e.g. using correct instance types, names are not too
        long, and resource names are correctly formatted).
      - Run promtool across all prometheus-rules.yaml, extracting all recording
        rules and alerts from the PrometheusRule resources files to check them
        for correctness.

  validate:

    summary: |-
      Initialise (if required) and validate the syntax of all the Flux
      kustomizations and Terraform configurations to ensure that the code is
      correct and valid for the set environment.

  security:
    desc: Run static analysis against configurations and resources
    summary: |-
      Run static code analysis tools against all the Terraform configurations
      to identify mis-configurations and security issues within the code
      by running the following steps:

      - Run Trivy against the Terraform configuration utilising the
        vulnerability, misconfiguration, and license scanners, looking for
        potential security and configuration errors.

      Update the README.md files for all Terraform configurations with a
      summary of the configuration, including information about the
      requirements, variables and outputs, as well as the resources
      created, using terraform-docs.
    silent: true

      configurations.
